## Polynomial Interpolators for High-Quality Resampling of Oversampled Audio
Revised version (October 2001): [deip.pdf](http://yehar.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/deip.pdf) (501 KiB)

Abstract:

"This paper discusses piece-wise polynomial interpolators used in audio resampling and presents new low-order designs that are optimized for high-quality resampling of oversampled audio. Source code and useful tables for using the interpolators are included."
